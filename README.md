#Simple Business back-end
So simple
- a Customer model (the person that buys)
- an Invoice model (the buyer doc)
- an Item model  (the thing to be sold )

All wrapped in a comfortable gradle - mavenizable project
i use this project when i need to hack with a generic db back end
uses h2 for convenience
